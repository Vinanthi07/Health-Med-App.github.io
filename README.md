# HealthMed Insight –  Smart Pre-Consultation and Patient Care Platform

## 🚀 Live Demo
 https://vinanthi07.github.io/Health-Med-App.github.io/
 
HealthMed Insight is a smart healthcare web application designed to improve clinical efficiency, patient safety, and post-care engagement by digitizing and structuring the entire OPD workflow — from patient entry to discharge summary.

🚀 Problem Statement

In real OPD scenarios:

Patients may hide habits (smoking, alcohol, allergies)

Doctors spend valuable time collecting basic history

Prescriptions are often handwritten, error-prone, and slow

Post-consultation patient education & follow-up is weak

⚠️ These gaps can lead to wrong drug reactions, delayed care, and poor patient outcomes.
💡 Our Solution

HealthMed Insight provides a complete digital workflow:

Patient enters → Data collected → Doctor reviews → Smart actions → Digital prescription → Post-care support → Auto summary

All in one connected system.
